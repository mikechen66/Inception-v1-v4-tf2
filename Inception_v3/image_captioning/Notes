Notes:

The model architecture is similar to Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption 
Generation with Visual Attention.

In this example, you will train a model on a relatively small amount of data—the 
first 30,000 captions for about 20,000 images (because there are multiple captions 
per image in the dataset).

1. Download and prepare the MS-COCO dataset

You will use the MS-COCO dataset to train our model. The dataset contains over 
82,000 images, each of which has at least 5 different caption annotations. The 
code below downloads and extracts the dataset automatically.If your internet
connection is slow, please download the datasets to your current directory. 

2. Inception v3

This notebook is an end-to-end example. While running the notebook during the 
runtime, it automatically  downloads the MS-COCO dataset, preprocesses and 
caches a subset of images using Inception V3, trains an encoder-decoder model, 
and generates captions on new images using the trained model.
